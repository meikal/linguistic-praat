Collection of simple PRAAT scripts for (semi)-automatic generation of phonetic illustrations

## Purpose

This is a collection of few simple PRAAT scripts I developed for my own needs to produce illustrations of phonetic data, such as waveforms and spectrograms.

## Compatibility
The scripts were tested on Praat 5.3.80 under Mac OS 10.9.4. The code may need slight adjustments to run on Windows.

## Acknowledgments
The Plot scripts are based on a MONO-PLOTTER script kindly shared with me by [Francesco Cangemi](http://phonetik.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fcangemi.html). I adopted the 'designs' for exports from JÃ¶rg Mayer's [Praat-Handbuch](http://praatpfanne.lingphon.net/das-praat-handbuch).
